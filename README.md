# Template for React Application

I created this for **educational purposes**.

## Usage

- Copy repository files in your folder,
- run `npm install`,
- change project _name_ and _author_ in `package.json` file,
- optionaly link your project to your github repo,
- code!

## Core dependencies

- [React/ReactDOM](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Avaliable scripts

### `npm run dev-server`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open http://localhost:6969 to view it in your browser.  
You can configure port in the `webpack.config.js`.

The page will reload when you make and save changes in your code.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
